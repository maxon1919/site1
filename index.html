    <p>I am currently a Student and I go to Hilton High school Mukono.I loved Programming and this forced
      me to start learning how to code.
      I struggled to start and seaching for a teacher who could teach
      me programming but in the process I learnt that i had to be self taught.
      <em>I started learning python in 2019</em> and built different projects in python. While at school during
      celebrations of OB and OG's at Hilton hilton high school I learnt about a
      guy called <strong><em>Katana Joshua </em></strong>
      who really insired me. He is a fullstack developer, so I made him my mentor and he introdeuced me
      to webdevelopment. That's how  I started learning Javascript. I love doing things on my own........
